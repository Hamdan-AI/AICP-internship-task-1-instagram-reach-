INTRODUCTION:

Understanding and predicting the reach of Instagram posts is crucial for content creators and businesses aiming to optimize their social media strategy. This project focuses on analyzing the historical 
Instagram reach data, identifying patterns and trends, and forecasting future reach using the SARIMA model

DATASET:

The dataset used in this project is Instagram-Reach.csv, which includes the following columns:

DATE: 

The date of the Instagram post.
Instagram reach: The reach of the Instagram post.

ANALYSIS:

The analysis includes the following steps:

DATA LOADING AND PREPROCESSING:

Load the data from Instagram-Reach.csv.
Check for null values, display column information, and descriptive statistics.
Convert the Date column to datetime format.


TREND ANALYSIS:

Plot a line chart to analyze the trend of Instagram reach over time.
Plot a bar chart to analyze the daily Instagram reach.
Use a box plot to analyze the distribution of Instagram reach.


Weekly Analysis:

Create a Day column to represent the day of the week.
Calculate and visualize the mean, median, and standard deviation of reach for each day of the week.
Forecasting
The forecasting part involves the following steps:

DECOMPOSITION:

Decompose the time series to check for trends and seasonal patterns.
Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:

Plot the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) to determine the SARIMA model parameters.

SARIMA Model:

Define and train the SARIMA model using the selected parameters.
Forecast the Instagram reach for the next 30 days.
Results
The analysis and forecasting results are visualized using matplotlib. The forecasted reach is plotted alongside the historical reach to provide a clear comparison.
